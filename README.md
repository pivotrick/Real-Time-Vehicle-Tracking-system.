# Real-Time-Vehicle-Tracking-system.
The Real-Time Vehicle Tracking System is a transportation solution aimed at providing real-time information to users regarding the availability of trucks and their routes. This system leverages advanced technologies like MQTT and other relevant services to gather data, ensuring users have reliable and up-to-date information about the truck transportation system. Developed for use in Himachal Pradesh, this system will revolutionize the efficiency and convenience of transportation.

# <h2>Problem Statement given at Smart India Hackathon(SIH)</h2>
To develop a smart transportation system, which that aims to provide real-time information to the users regarding the availability of vehicles and their upcoming timings. The system will utilize advanced technologies such as GPS and other relevant services to gather the necessary data for providing reliable information to the users. The proposed system will have to be designed to facilitate the users in identifying the current location of their desired vehicles, along with the estimated time of its arrival at the respective location. This will be achieved through the integration of the real-time data from the vehicles, as well as from the traffic management system. In conclusion, the proposed smart transportation system will significantly enhance the efficiency and convenience of the public transportation system in Himachal Pradesh. As a sustainability information to the user, good to indicate emission compliance of the vehicle, also if the vehicle uses clean fuel such as CNG or Electricity.

# <h2>Significance/Novelty of problem</h2>
For companies to achieve optimum performance and cost-effectiveness, a fleet management system has become a game-changer. The worldwide fleet management marketplace is projected to hit $34 billion by 2025, up from $19.9 billion in 2020, according to marketsandmarkets. Cloud-based fleet management software and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are among the primary drivers of this acceleration, which supports the fact.

# <h2>Brief Description of the Solution Approach</h2>
The solution approach for a fleet management system involves analysing the requirements and 
designing a software application that addresses the needs of fleet operations. 
The system utilizes MySQL as the database management system for data storage and integrates MQTT protocol for real-time communication and device integration. Python with libraries like paho-mqtt and HiveMQ is used to implement MQTT clients. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are employed for front-end development, providing structure, style, and interactivity to the user interface. PHP is used as the server-side scripting language for handling server tasks, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic web content. The Maps Embed API from Google is integrated to embed customized Google Maps, enhancing the system's user interface and providing interactive map functionality. This comprehensive approach ensures real-time tracking, route optimization, reporting, and a userfriendly interface for efficient fleet management.

# <h2>Feautures </h2>
1. **Real-Time Truck Tracking:** Customers and operators can track the current location of buses in real-time on a digital map.
2. **Booking:** Customers can book their trucks for transportation.
4. **Communication:** Customers can directly communicate with the bus drivers.
5. **Data Collection:** Relevant data from the fleet management system itself, as well as from other 
sources such as vehicle sensors, GPS trackers, maintenance records, and driver feedback. The data 
includes metrics like fuel consumption, mileage, acceleration, etc.
6. **Cost Analysis:** The cost savings achieved through the fleet management system. Expenses 
before and after implementation, considering factors such as fuel consumption, maintenance costs, 
vehicular traffic, and vehicle downtime.
7. **Maintenance Management:** The system affects maintenance practices as well as upgradation. 
Proactive maintenance scheduling, reduced breakdowns, improved vehicle uptime, and optimized 
maintenance resources.
8. **System Usability:** User-friendliness and effectiveness of the fleet from the perspective of fleet 
managers and drivers.
9. **Limitations and Future Directions:** Data availability, sample size, or generalizability. 
Identification of areas for further research, potential enhancements to the system, or additional 
metrics that could be considered are tough to incorporate.
10. **Security and Privacy:** The system ensures the security and privacy of fleet data, including user credentials, location, and communication.
